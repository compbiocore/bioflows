# Downloading SRA Files

QCDB is currently built to use the outputs generated by Bioflows \([https://compbiocore.github.io/bioflows/](https://compbiocore.github.io/bioflows/)\), a package designed to automate running bioinformatics workflows. To run bioflows:

* Connect to Oscar: `ssh user@ssh.ccv.brown.edu` and enter password when prompted
* Switch to the cbcollab group: `newgrp cbcollab`
* Create a yaml file to download reads from SRA and run them in bioflows -- here is an example that  downloads human transcriptome data, runs some QC on the reads, aligns them to the genome, and runs some alignment QC. 
  * This example has dummy values in place for `sample_manifest:sra:entrez_email` and `run_parms:ssh_user` -- these should be edited before attempting to use this example.
  * To run bioflows on a different SRA sample, edit the fields for `bioproject:`and  `sample_manifest:sra:id` . You may also need to edit `run_parms:gtf_file:` and`run_parms:reference_fasta_path` to reflect the appropriate reference and annotations, as well as `workflow_sequence:gsnap` if gsnap is not the appropriate alignment tool for your data.

* After saving your yaml file, start a screen session -- here is an example of how to start a screen session named `bioflows_qcdb`:

`screen -S bioflows_qcdb`

* Activate the conda environment:

`source /gpfs/runtime/cbc_conda/bin/activate_cbc_conda`

* Run bioflows using the yaml you just created -- in this example, we are assuming the yaml is called `bioflows_qcdb.yaml`:

`bioflows-run bioflows_qcdb.yaml`

* Bioflows will create a series of folders inside the working directory you specified in your yaml file. The outputs that will be useful for qcdb will be located in the directory called `qc`
