Currently, we have implemented some standard workflows alongwith tutorials using this package. To start using bioflows use the quick start to go to any of the tutorials implemented Quickstart RNA Seq with GSNAP RNA-Seq on CCV QIIME2 QIIME2 on CCV GATK GERMLINE Variant Calling on CCV GATK SOMATIC Somatic variant Calling on CCV Motivation A primary objective of the Computational Biology Core at Brown's Centre for Computational Biology of Human Disease , is to enable reproducibility in computational analysis of NGS data. Critical to this objective is to provide a simple tool for creating/running bioinformatics workflows as well as consistent software environments across multiple platforms. To this we: Developed bioflows a workflow tool to ensure consistency in analysis steps and stages with interoperability across multiple job submission systems Use CONDA package management system for managing software tools Container based approach using docker for cross-platform interoperability of the analysis environment Overview bioflows is an user-friendly python implementation of a workflow manager. The user is expected to not have any programming knowledge and needs to only provide a control file in a YAML format, chosen for its human readability. The goal here is to provide users with a simple and straight-forward interface for processing NGS datasets with many samples using standard bioinformatics pipelines, e.g RNA-seq, GATK variant calling etc. The tool is developed to alleviate some of the primary issues with scaling up pipelines, such as file naming, management of data, output and logs. How it works bioflows uses two main python packages: 1) luigi developed at spotify for managing dependencies among task and 2) SAGA python API to launch jobs across different types of systems. All the necessary tools are provided from the ** CBCs anaconda channel . Key Features Currently bioflows provides the following features: Simple management of data logs results scripts A module to easily download data from NCBI's SRA archive and to optionally directly continue processing the data through the pipelines. A few key elements of this module are: Only download and convert the data to usable fastqs Data from multiple runs are concatenated automatically Metadata associated with the SRA data is also provided as a seperate table Conda packages for all dependencies are already pre-built and provided alongwith the software Conda Package Management CONDA is a system agnostic software package management system based on the Anaconda python distribution to ensure that a software and all its dependencies are bundled together. These conda packages can be downloaded from various publicly available repositories called channels and one such channel for bio-informatics tools is bioconda. For ensuring reproducibily, we have established a publicly accessible channel for all programs that are included with wrappers within the bioflows tool through the compbiocore channel . In this channel, we have also provided conda packages of all software used including the bioflows package itself. To download specific packages or the bioflows tool use the following command into your conda environment: Note bioflows and its dependencies are available as conda packages for the linux OS only.

A visual overview of the workflow is shown below Getting Started Basic workflow The workflow consists of the following programs run sequentially on each sample: Fastqc : For QC of Raw Fastq reads Trimmomatic : Quality and Adapter trimming of raw reads Fastqc : Post trimming QC of reads GSNAP : alignment of the reads to the reference genome Samtools : To process alignments: convert sam to bam remove unmapped reads coordinate sort bam index bam biobambam Suite bamsort Sort bams bammarkduplicates2 Mark duplicates Qualimap QC of the aligments generated featureCounts/HTseq Expression quantification based on counting mapped reads Salmon : Alignment free quantification of known transcripts Depending on the user's need the workflow can be adapted for just using a subset of steps or the changes in the sequence as long as they are sensible. We povide a couple of alternative workflows using combinations of the steps in the basic workflow Steps The basic steps to running a workflow are: Create a control file Create your working directory if does not exist, here we assume it is /users/mydir . Setup a screen session The next section provide a short how-to with all the commands to execute the test workflow on Brown University's OSCAR HPCcluster. Once you have the test case working you can implement this on your own data Prerequisites Make sure you have access to the OSCAR cluster or request one by contacting support@ccv.brown.edu. If you are not comfortable with the Linux environment, you can consult the tutorial here. You should also set up bioflows. Danger You need to have an priority account on OSCAR to run this with real datasets as the resources for exploratory accounts are not sufficient. Caution The working directory in a real example can end up being quite large: up to a few terabytes. On OSCAR, you would create the working directory in a location such as your data folder or the scratch folder. Running the workflow Create the YAML file Bioflows uses YAML configuration files to run workflows. A detailed documentation of the YAML file and all the options is shown here . For the current example, copy the following code into a text file and save it in /users/mydir as test_run.yaml .
